# Process-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator

A topic of Operating Systems named Process Scheduling has been visulaized.

This Zip file consists of a folder containing 3 files HTML, CSS and JS.

This projects has been made with sole purpose of getting better understanding of Process Scheduling Algorithms along with all the necessary calculations.

The logic has been made using JavaScript.

Visualization of 4 Process Scheduling Algorithms are Provided : 
# RR (Round Robin)
# SJF (Shortest Job First)
# FCFS (First Come First Serve)
# SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)

Steps to Proceed with this Project (Though it is pretty Straight forward):
1. Open the HTML file in a Browser.
2. By default RR is selected as Process Scheduling Method.
3. One can select the method with the dropdown menu.
4. In Case of RR, a Natural Number needs to be provided to the Time Quantum Field.
5. To add a process, click on "Add Process".
6. Once you are done adding the processes, click on "Run Algorithm".

You will be able to see the Gantt Chart, Ready Queue(For RR and SRTF only) and a Process Desription Table and Average Calculations.
